# Product Manager

This project is for product management and we can add 3 types of products (DVD, Furniture and Book), each one with particular characteristics. 

We can also mass delete products by checking the checkbox in the product list and pressing MASS DELETE on the top of the page.

## Technologies used

I used PHP as the programming language and MariaDB (mysql) for the database. 

For connecting with the database I used the PDO library. 

Everything is made using OOP. 

Also used Bootstrap in the forms (for adding new products).

* PHP (OOP)
* PDO
* SQL (mariadb)
